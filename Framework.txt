***************** Please Use "localhost:8889" in host name becasue this is  the port where mysql is running. I could not figure out a way to change this to just local host and moreover I did not
want to mess up my mamp settings in the last minute. If you dont use "localhost:8889" in host name most probably the database wont be connected. So please consider this.********************** 


***Please Ignore the last two arist beacuse they dont have any artwork inside their profile. I just created those two profile to see
if my createAccount.php works properly ***

***Moreover, I had to create the database name with lowercase only becuase the system did not allow me to write it in the other way***
